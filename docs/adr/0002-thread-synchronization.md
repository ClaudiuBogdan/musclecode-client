# ADR 0002: Thread Synchronization Mechanism

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs to synchronize chat threads between the client and server to ensure data consistency and provide offline capabilities. Users should be able to see their chat history across devices and have their conversations persisted even if they lose connection temporarily.

## Decision

We've implemented a client-side thread synchronization mechanism with the following characteristics:

1. **Local Storage Persistence**: Chat threads are stored in local storage using Zustand's persist middleware.

2. **Synchronization API**: The client communicates with the server through a dedicated `/api/v1/chat/threads/sync` endpoint.

3. **Efficient Synchronization**: The client sends only metadata about threads (IDs, message counts, and timestamps) to the server, which responds with full thread data only for threads that need updating.

4. **Automatic Synchronization Triggers**:
   - When a user navigates to the algorithms page
   - When a user switches to a different algorithm
   - When the Chat component mounts (if no recent sync has occurred)

5. **Error Handling and Retry Logic**: Failed synchronization attempts are automatically retried after a delay.

6. **Throttling**: Synchronization is throttled to prevent excessive API calls.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Users can access their chat history across devices
- Reduced server load by only transferring necessary data
- Improved offline capabilities with local storage persistence
- Automatic synchronization provides a seamless user experience

### Negative

- Potential for data conflicts if multiple devices modify the same thread simultaneously
- Local storage has size limitations that could be reached with extensive chat history
- Additional complexity in the client-side state management

## Implementation Details

The implementation consists of:

1. **Types and Interfaces**: Defined in `src/types/chat.ts`
2. **API Function**: Implemented in `src/lib/api/chat.ts`
3. **Store Integration**: Added to the Zustand store in `src/stores/chat.ts`
4. **Component Integration**: Integrated with `InfoPanel.tsx` and `Chat.tsx`

## Future Considerations

- Implement conflict resolution strategies for simultaneous edits
- Add a visual indicator when synchronization is in progress
- Consider implementing a WebSocket-based real-time synchronization for collaborative features
- Add pagination or archiving for older threads to manage local storage size
