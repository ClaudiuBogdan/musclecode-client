I'll help create an ADR (Architecture Decision Record) for implementing optional Keycloak authentication in the React application. I'll analyze the requirements and create a comprehensive specification document.

# Optional Keycloak Authentication Integration

Version/Date: v1.0 - 2024-03-19

## Action
Created (New Feature)

## Business Logic / Feature Description
- Implements an optional authentication layer using Keycloak
- Provides configurable access control for protected routes
- Maintains application functionality in both authenticated and non-authenticated modes
- Handles token lifecycle management and security

## Edge Cases
- Application state during token refresh
- Network failures during authentication flow
- Race conditions between auth state changes and protected route access
- Token expiration during active user session
- Handling deep links to protected routes when auth is enabled
- Browser storage limitations or restrictions

## Why (Justification / Rationale)
- Enables flexible deployment scenarios with optional authentication
- Provides enterprise-grade security when needed
- Allows seamless development and testing in both auth/non-auth modes
- Supports future scalability for different authentication requirements

## How (Implementation Strategy)

### Authentication Provider
```typescript
// Using existing state management tools:
- Zustand for client-side auth state
- TanStack Query for token refresh operations
```

### Core Components
1. **Auth Configuration**
   - Environment-based setup using Vite's env variables
   - Feature flag implementation

2. **Token Management**
   - Secure storage using browser's storage mechanisms
   - Refresh token rotation
   - Token validation logic

3. **Protected Routes**
   - Integration with @tanstack/react-router
   - Auth guard implementation
   - Public route definitions

### Technology Stack Integration
- **State Management**: 
  - Zustand for auth state
  - TanStack Query for token operations
- **Routing**: 
  - @tanstack/react-router for protected routes
- **UI Components**: 
  - Shadcn/ui for auth-related UI elements
- **TypeScript**: 
  - Type definitions for auth states and tokens

### Configuration Structure
```typescript
interface AuthConfig {
  enabled: boolean;
  keycloakUrl: string;
  realm: string;
  clientId: string;
  publicPaths: string[];
}
```

## Additional Notes / References

### Security Considerations
- Token storage security
- XSS protection measures
- CSRF prevention
- Secure communication channels

### Development Guidelines
1. Local Development:
   - Mock auth provider for development
   - MSW integration for auth endpoints
   - Environment configuration examples

2. Testing Strategy:
   - Unit tests for auth logic
   - Integration tests for protected routes
   - E2E tests for auth flows

### Future Considerations
- Support for multiple auth providers
- Role-based access control
- Custom authentication flows
- SSO integration capabilities

### Related Specifications
- Core Technical Specification (specs/CLIENT_TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION.md)
- Existing Auth Specification (specs/AUTH_SPECIFICATION.md)
```

This specification provides a comprehensive guide for implementing the optional Keycloak authentication layer while maintaining compatibility with the existing application architecture. It addresses all the primary requirements, technical constraints, and success criteria while leveraging the current technology stack effectively.

Would you like me to proceed with creating the initial implementation of any specific component of this authentication system?
