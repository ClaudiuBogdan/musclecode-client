# Code Execution Specifications

## Action: Updated
**Business Logic Description**: The code execution system now sends all files (solution and test files) for the active language to the server for execution. The server combines these files and executes them together to validate both the solution implementation and test cases.

## Edge Cases
- Empty files
- Missing test files
- Invalid file combinations
- Syntax errors in either solution or test files
- Runtime errors during test execution
- Memory limits and timeouts
- Large file sizes
- Invalid file encodings

## Why
This change improves the code execution system by:
1. Enabling proper test execution alongside solution code
2. Providing more accurate validation of solutions
3. Supporting test-driven development practices
4. Allowing for more complex test scenarios
5. Enabling better error reporting and debugging

## How
The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **File Collection**:
   - All files for the active language are collected from the store
   - Files are organized by their type (solution/test)
   - File content is validated before sending

2. **API Communication**:
   - Files are sent as a Record<string, string> to the server
   - The API maintains backward compatibility
   - Proper error handling is implemented

3. **Execution**:
   - Files are combined in the correct order
   - Test environment is properly set up
   - Results include both execution and test outcomes
   - Proper cleanup is performed after execution

4. **Result Handling**:
   - Test results are properly parsed and displayed
   - Error messages are clear and actionable
   - Performance metrics are tracked
   - State is updated appropriately

## Implementation Details

```typescript
interface CodeRunRequest {
  algorithmId: string;
  language: string;
  files: Record<string, string>;
}

async function runCode(request: CodeRunRequest): Promise<CodeExecutionResponse> {
  // Implementation details...
}
```

## Security Considerations
1. Input validation for all files
2. Execution timeouts
3. Memory limits
4. Sandboxed execution environment
5. Proper error handling and logging
