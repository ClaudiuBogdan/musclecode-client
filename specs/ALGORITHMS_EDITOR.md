# Algorithm Editor Module Specification

## Overview

A comprehensive interface for creating and editing algorithm challenges, enabling users to manage algorithm content, test cases, and associated files through an intuitive UI.

## User Stories

1. As an user, I want to create new algorithm challenges with descriptions, test cases, and solution templates
2. As an user, I want to modify existing algorithms' content and test cases
3. As an user, I want to manage multiple language support for each algorithm
4. As an user, I want to validate test cases against solution implementations
5. As an user, I want to see when the data is auto-saved or if there are any errors
